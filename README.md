Extreme PHP Cache
===============

You can install **Extreme PHP Cache** either via package download from github or via composer install. I encourage you to do the latter:
 
```json  
{ 
  "require": {
    "gigabyte/cache": "dev-master"
  }
} 
```

This PHP library makes it easy to cache any php object to the cache with the specific parameters. Currently it only support file system cache.

Basic usage
------------
```php
namespace gigabyte\cache;

//initialize the class
```
